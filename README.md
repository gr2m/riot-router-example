# riot-router-example

> simple riot.js app with route-based content toggling

This is a simple application using [riot.js v2.6.0](http://riotjs.com/release-notes/#august-20-2016)
that defines routes in tags that show/hide themselves based on the current route.

I created it as a learning example for Hoodieâ€™s [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/)
Team 2016: [Titay & Hyesoo a.k.a. Team Rookies](https://rookies-2016rgsoc.rhcloud.com/)

## Usage

Clone repository

```
git clone https://github.com/gr2m/riot-router-example.git
cd riot-router-example
```

Start a local http server in the folder. This will work on Mac or Linux:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Open `index.html` in your browser at the server URL.
